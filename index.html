                            <p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong> The "Establish a theory" step involves making an educated guess about the problem's cause. The OSI model is a powerful tool for this. A common troubleshooting method is to form theories layer by layer (e.g., "Is it a physical cable issue?" - Layer 1 theory; "Is it an IP address issue?" - Layer 3 theory). This structured approach helps narrow down possibilities efficiently.</p>

                                <li><strong>Implement the solution:</strong> This happens after you've tested your theory and confirmed the cause.</li>
                                <li><strong>Create a plan of action:</strong> This step comes just before implementation, where you decide *how* to fix the problem.</li>
                                <li><strong>Verify functionality:</strong> This is the final step, performed after the fix is applied to ensure the problem is resolved.</li>

                            <p class="mt-2"><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The OSI model provides a systematic framework for troubleshooting network issues by breaking down complex problems into manageable layers.</p>

                           <p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong> The <strong>Presentation Layer (Layer 6)</strong> is responsible for data translation, formatting, and syntax. This includes key security functions like encryption and decryption (e.g., SSL/TLS). Its job is to ensure that data sent from one system's application layer is readable by the destination system's application layer, and encryption is a critical part of that process.</p>

                               <li><strong>Application (Layer 7):</strong> Provides the user interface to the network (e.g., browser) but relies on lower layers for encryption.</li>
                               <li><strong>Session (Layer 5):</strong> Manages the dialogue between devices but doesn't handle the data's format or encryption.</li>
                               <li><strong>Transport (Layer 4):</strong> Manages end-to-end data delivery (e.g., TCP/UDP) but not its encryption.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p class="mt-2"><strong>Real-world Example:</strong> When you visit a secure website (HTTPS), the encryption happens at the Presentation Layer, even though your browser (Application Layer) initiates the connection.</p>

                            <p><strong>Why this is correct:</strong> A <strong>load balancer</strong> is specifically designed to distribute network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. It improves responsiveness and increases availability of applications.</p>

                                <li><strong>Router:</strong> Connects different networks and routes traffic between them, but doesn't distribute traffic across servers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Switch:</strong> Connects devices within the same network and forwards traffic based on MAC addresses.</li>
                                <li><strong>Firewall:</strong> Provides security by filtering traffic but doesn't distribute load.</li>
